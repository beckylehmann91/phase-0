# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

For the “Think About Time” assignment, I mainly focused on meditation and developing habits. What I really like about these two ideas is that they both fit very naturally into the concept of growth mindset. In both cases, a person can use behavior (specifically, small and iterative behaviors) to strengthen his/her mindset to be more productive. I think of meditation as a means of not only diminishing existing stress, but also as a way to establish a stronger emotional foundation for future sources of stress. The U.S. work culture sometimes implicitly celebrates “workaholicism,” so I think it’s incredibly important to emphasize the productive benefits of daily relaxation and meditation. Habits are similarly repetitive and seem to provide an effective way of incorporating small, positive behaviors into one’s lifestyle, helping a person to achieve larger, often intimidating outcomes.

“Time Boxing” is the practice of setting aside a specific and agreed upon time period for working toward the completion of a goal. In Phase 0, we will be given a variety of challenges that will provide the potential for overworking ourselves and exhausting energy. Especially during this phase, when we are balancing DBC with other aspects of our lives (work, family, etc.), time boxing will serve as an essential tool for managing these productivity “risks.” By reserving 25 minutes (or whatever period of time) to work on a challenge, I know I will be able to ensure I am completing my assignments while maintaining a productive and healthy work “flow.”

Similarly to the time boxing technique, I like to break up my work into increments. I have never been the type (even in college) to pull “all nighters” or to work for extended periods of time on any assignment. I prefer to work in smaller, highly productive increments, giving myself permission to take occasional breaks. Also, if I am feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work I need to complete, I focus on completing one task at a time. This worked very well for me in school and I plan to continue using this work style at DBC.

In addition, I plan to employ the habit-forming and meditation techniques I discussed previously. As one of the articles mentioned, confidence is just “displayed ability.” I believe by focusing on my behaviors and “proving” to myself that I can be successful with coding, I will naturally develop and maintain a positive attitude.

Overall, my plan for Phase 0 time management is to set aside time for all productive activities in my life. This means balancing commitments to DBC challenges, work, physical wellness, mental and emotional fulfillment, and social enjoyment. It is my belief that by being intentional about energy investment into all aspects of one’s life leads to greater productivity and success in every aspect.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

 In the context that we are using it, a shell is an interface where a user can navigate through the operating system using the command line. Bash is a type of Unix shell. In going through the material, I immediately found it challenging to adjust to the CLI, as I am much more familiar with the GUI. The video also provided a lot of information very quickly, which made it challenging to keep up. However, once I began to break down the commands and arguments in the Crash Course, the information became much more accessible. In the course, I was able to successfully able to use all the commands. Per the disclaimer, however, I imagine I will need a lot more practice and memorization before I feel totally comfortable with the CLI.

It is hard to say which commands and arguments will be most important. I found in almost every exercise, I used some of the more basic arguments, such as “cd,” “pwd,” and “ls.” In terms of efficiency (one of the key benefits of CLI mentioned in the video), I imagine commands like “grep” will become very helpful when I need to navigate through lengthy files. My explanations for all the listed commands are below:

- pwd: “print working directory,” tells you the directory where you are currently located/working
- ls: “list directory,” shows you the contents of the specified directory
- mv: “move file,” essentially renaming a file
- cd: “change directory,” switch to a different directory
- ../: allows you to go “back” or “up” one directory
- touch: make empty file
- mkdir: “make directory,” create new directory
- less: page through file
- rmdir: “remove directory”
- rm: “remove file”
- help: similar to “apropos,” shows you what a command does (typically would use only if you can’t remember the name of the command…if you know the name, you might use “man” instead)
