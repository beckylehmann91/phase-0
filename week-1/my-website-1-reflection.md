- Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

  https://github.com/beckylehmann91/beckylehmann91.github.io.git

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

  1. Under "Repositories" on your GitHub profile, click the "New" button on the right-hand side
  2. Add a repository name, define it as public or private (typically you want the repo to be public) and select whether you would like to initialize with a ReadMe file
  3. Once you've created the repository and opened it, copy the repository URL on the right-hand side of the page
  4. Open your CLI (on a Mac, for example, this would be your terminal)
  5. Type in the command "git clone" followed by the URL you copied above
  6. If you successfully cloned the repository, you should be able to find it in a local file on your laptop

- Describe what open source means.

  Open source means sharing how a computer program was made and allowing others to customize the program (Skillcrush).

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

  I think Open Source is a great way to share knowledge as well as ascertain feedback on code you have created. Open Source does not make me particularly nervous, especially because of licensing. Through licenses, you can control the permissions of your code and still get "credit" for the work you have done. I think the licenses themselves evidence that Open Source is not perfect or "utopian" and requires some level of management and protection.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

  I think it's an essential way to maintain ownership and control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. It still allows others to openly and freely provide feedback while ensuring the right person or people get credit and have protection.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

  I think the challenge helps to clarify the connections between local repos, remote repos (GitHub) and translating all of that information to a website. It shows a little more of the end-to-end process, which served as an "aha" moment for me. I think my process with all of this is still a little slow and "clunky," but I'm sure I will become more used to all of it with practice.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

  I did not find any additional resources.
