- What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of Web Design are Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, and Maintenance.

- What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my site will be to provide information about me (my project work, prior experience, education etc.) and promote a service (aka my web development services, mainly while I am trying to get a job). In terms of content, the website will provide specific information about my prior experience, interests, skills, abilities and web development philosophy. To promote my own "products and services," I will include a portfolio to feature my web development work.

- What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is potential web development employers. An employer will be interested in exploring my portfolio and prior experience. The company would also want to get an understanding of my personality and work philosophy to gauge whether I would fit into its culture. My site would address both interests by offering an overview of who I am, my experience, my skills/abilities and providing samples of my work product.

- What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Immediately upon coming to my site, I would like the user to first search for information on my "About Me" page (this would be the "primary action"). This will provide him/her with an overview of who I am and my experiences. Next, I would like the user to view my portfolio to understand the work I am capable of producing. Finally, I would like the user to visit the "Contact" page to reach out for more information for further discussion. Therefore, I would like all the actions listed above to take place, but in a certain order.

- What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Within the last decade, there has been a significant shift in web design philosophy. In the past, as Jacob Gube puts it, "we designed for ourselves," focusing on fulfilling the wants/needs of the designer and client rather than the user. However, with the transformation of the Web - increased frequency, volume and modes of Web accesibility - design has naturally become user-centered. Designers and clients can no longer cater exclusively to their own preferences, but rather (in order to survive and thrive) must take into account the preferences and behaviors of the user. Hence, the ascendance of user experience.

User experience (UX) is "how a person feels when interfacing with a system." It takes into account usability, human factors, utility, HCI (human-computer interaction), ergonomics, system performance, design, accessibility and marketing. Conceptually, it's similar to the idea of brand positioning in the field of marketing; a company can control what it does with its logo, advertising and promotions, but it can't control the perception of the brand in the eye of the consumer (i.e. brand positioning). By researching and managing the factors listed above, companies work toward optimizing user experience.

- What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is a design methodology that aims to optimize how a user "feels" when using a system, taking into account things like ease of use, perceived value, utility and efficiency. As mentioned in the previous section, user-centered design has become essential to web design and consumption. Companies (or individuals) who undervalue the importance of user-centered design and UX in creating and maintaining their web presences risk becoming obsolete. As web accesibility and usage becomes more prevalent, design must cater more and more to user preferences and needs.

- Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

To be honest, parts of the reflection felt somewhat tedious to me. Creating the site map was pretty straight forward, so I think the challenge could be shortened by decreasing some of the redundancy in the questions.
