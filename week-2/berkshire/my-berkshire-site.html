- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I really enjoyed working with HTML and seeing how the elements work together to create a functional web page. HTML is a fun language to use because even with limited knowledge, anyone can begin to build and apply concepts.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

The HTML5 semantic elements are pretty new to me, so at first it was difficult to understand the distinction between elements like <div> and <section>. However, I think with practice, the distinction between the elements will become clearer. Even with my limited experience, I found the semantic elements served as helpful tools for breaking up the parts of the page in a logical way.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

The best practices are a bit of an adjustment for me, mainly because I began learning HTML on Codecademy before applying to DBC. I do think, however, that DBC's methodology of separating structure from formatting (HTML from CSS) creates a clearer dichotomy between the two languages. In the long run, I think this will clear up confusion about where to add stylistic components.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML seems to be a very "programmer-friendly" language and many of the elements are intuitive. The nesting aspects of HTML help me to think through how the different elements work together on a web page and allow me to "book-end" my text into blocks. It also the only markup language used to build web pages, which inherently makes in valuable. I suppose one downside of HTML is that it's not self-sufficient when it comes to front-end web development. Any given web page involves a "conversation" between the HTML and CSS code. Because a site's structure has implications for its styling (and vice versa), I imagine a programmer must frequently flip back and forth between HTML and CSS files in order to create the structure and format he/she wants.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I like to think about the different tag "sandwiches" I need for my code to function. I always start an HTML file with the main opening and closing tags: doctype, html, head and body. From there, I think conceptually about how I want my site to look: what are the different sections of the site? How would I break up the information? I define each of those "blocks" using other tags, like section, div, nav, article, etc. I also try to use proper indentation (although, I'm definitely not perfect about that yet!) to keep track of the different tags involved in the code.
