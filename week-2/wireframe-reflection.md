- What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is essentially a blueprint that allows you to define the information hierarchy and layout of your design. It can also give insight into how a user would interact with the interface.

- What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing is a beneficial step in the design process because it enables the designer to consider the interface layout before determining factors like the colors, typeface and copy. It also pushes the designer to consider multiple layout options before committing to one layout and one design. By saving versions of wireframes, a designer can always revert back to the "foundational" aspects of the interface and reconsider ways to more effectively engage the end user.

- Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I did enjoy wireframing my site! I will say, I intend my website to be incredibly simplistic when it comes to the number and placement of page elements. I'd like to limit the amount of text on the page (basically, to things like navigation and a tagline) and include vibrant design and graphics. However, it is difficult (impossible, actually) to convey what the graphics will look like in a wireframe, so I realize the wireframe may look very basic to another viewer. Also, not all of the "required" elements (such as my picture) will be on the home page (or "index" file), which is hard to convey through a wireframe.

- Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I used the "thumbnail" technique that was recommended in one of the Beginner's Guide articles. The wireframe I ended up using was my sixth idea. Often times (at least according to that article), the first idea tends to be the most generic. As I created more versions of the wireframe, I challenged myself to add more variety and consider how my personal brand and my audience should affect the layout.

- What questions did you ask during this challenge?

  - Who is my audience?
  - What is the first thing I want the user to understand about me when he/she enters the site?
  - What are the key page elements? How do I want to incorporate them?
  - What type of user experience do I want to create with my layout?
  - What story do I want to tell?

- What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I searched through some wireframe examples provided in the Beginner's Guide (within "I <3 Wireframes" and "Wirify"). These helped me to understand the thought process and techniques for building a wireframe. I especially enjoyed the "thumbnail" technique because it forced me to think "outside the box" when creating layouts. Then, I looked at different styles of wireframes to understand how each wireframe related to its unique interface. Through these resources, I envisioned what my page might look like - what effect, impression and experience I want to create - and selected a wireframe from there.

- Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed thinking through what the final product might look like and using the wireframe to establish the foundational components. I am especially excited to create a website for myself because it gives me complete freedom to design for my personal brand. I didn't find any parts of the challenge to be particularly tedious. I can certainly see how it might be easy to "go down a rabbit hole" with wireframing, as the instructions warned. However, by keeping to rough sketches and not aiming for a "perfect" product, I was able to come up with the wireframes relatively quickly.
